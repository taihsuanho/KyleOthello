# KyleOthello

This Othello chess game was my first pygame work written in early 2016, originally intended for a tutorial teaching my 12-year-old son, Kyle, coding with python. Unfortunately, he was not interested in coding at all. 

I put my codes here, hopefully anyone can get inspired or help from my work. In these pygame codes, I created some samll but useful UI functions, such as buttons, switch, animation, animating slider, message box with optional OK and CANCEL buttons, talking box showing text character-by-character, and timer mechanism to invoke a function or post a message with arguments after a specified time delay.

I hope you enjoy playing Othello with my son, and welcome to leave me any comments about the game, especially on the artificial intelligence part. About license of the codes, I actually have no idea about it. I think anyone is free to use my code, just give me some credit.
