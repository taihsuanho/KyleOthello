# KyleOthello

This Othello chess game was my first pygame work written in early 2016, originally intended for a tutorial teaching my 12-year-old son, Kyle, coding with python. Unfortunately, he was not interested in coding at all. 

I put my codes here, hopefully anyone can get inspired or help from my work. In these pygame codes, I created some small but useful UI functions, such as buttons, switch, animation, animating slider, message box with optional OK and CANCEL buttons, talking box showing text character-by-character, and timer mechanism to invoke a function or post a message with arguments after a specified time delay.

Before playing the game, you can copy some JPG and MP3 files you like into BKIMG and BGM folders respectively, so as to show those images sliding under the chess board and to enable the playback of background music. The JPGs can be in any size, but if their dimension is 800x600, it will consume much less CPU resources for image conversion.

I hope you enjoy playing Othello with the avatar of my son, actually the computer, and welcome to leave me any comments about the game, especially on the artificial intelligence part. About license of the codes, I actually have no idea about it. I think anyone is free to use my code, just giving me some credit.
